Script `NoiseCalculation.m` computes HP signals at default parameters listed in Tables 1 and 2 of draft. From the computed HP signals, peak pyruvate is computed which is used as a reference signal for noise computation in the draft. 

The variables in this script is saved as `def_params.mat`. `def_params.mat` is then used by various scripts to easily get the values of default parameters and reference signal (i.e., peak pyruvate using default parameters) for further calculations.
